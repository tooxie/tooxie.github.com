<h2>
    About me
</h2>

Hi! I'm Alvaro. I live currently in Berlin, but I was born in
[Uruguay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montevideo), where I lived until the
age of 27. My main interest is Web Development, that's what I work with and
what I do in my free time. Let me tell you about some projects I've been
working on:


<h3>
    Projects
</h3>

All my code is [Free Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software),
which means that you are free to download it, modify it and redistribute it
without asking for my permission (you already have it.)

<h3>
    Technologies
</h3>

The main languages I work with are Python and (server-side) JavaScript. I'm
always open to learn about new technologies, but don't even ask me to write PHP
if you want me to take you seriously.


<h3>
    Let's talk business
</h3>

Do you have an interesting offer for me? I'm always open to talk. Just drop me
an e-mail to <i>alvaro@mourino.net</i> and let's talk.
