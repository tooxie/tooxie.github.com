<h2>
    Privacy
</h2>

Privacy is something that I take seriously. Adding an analytics (A.K.A.
tracking) software to this page is something that I didn't do lightly.

I don't use Google services for that because I won't give away your information
away to a corporation. I won't use my own servers to perpetuate their
omnipotence.

That's why I downloaded and installed myself
<a href="http://piwik.org/">Piwik</a>, an analytics tool that is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software">Free Software</a> and
allows me to be in control of the information. It also provides an opt-out
feature that will let you decide if you don't want to be identified:
